## Type:        string
## Default:     ""
## ServiceRestart: apache2
#
# Which config file do you want to use?
# (if not set, /etc/apache2/httpd.conf is used.)
# It is unusual to need to use this setting.
#
# Note about ulimits:
#   if you want to set ulimits, e.g. to increase the max number of open file handle, 
#   or to allow core files, you can do so by editing /etc/sysconfig/apache2 and
#   simply write the ulimit commands into that file.
#   Example:
#     ulimit -n 16384
#     ulimit -H -n 16384
#     ulimit -c unlimited
#   See the output of "help ulimit" in the bash, or "man 1 ulimit".
